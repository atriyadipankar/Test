# Data Analytics Application - Implementation Details

## Project Development Timeline

### Step 1: CSV Upload UI Enhancement and API Integration

#### User Request
The user requested improvements to the CSV upload UI to match a Kaggle-style design. The requirements included:
- Making the upload popup wider (covering 3/5 of viewport width)
- Restricting file uploads to CSV files only
- Implementing backend API integration to parse uploaded files

#### Implementation
1. **UploadDataSheet Component Enhancements**:
   - Increased popup width to ~60% of viewport width with max-width: 800px
   - Added file type restrictions to only allow CSV files
   - Implemented drag-and-drop functionality with file type validation
   - Added client-side CSV parsing to extract headers and count rows

2. **API Development**:
   - Created API route handler at `src/app/api/edgestore/[...edgestore]/ingestion/route.ts`
   - Implemented GET method for retrieving ingestion jobs with filtering options
   - Implemented POST method for creating new ingestion jobs
   - Used mock data for demonstration purposes

3. **Component-API Integration**:
   - Enhanced the upload function to extract file metadata
   - Sent file details to the API via POST request
   - Added error handling and user feedback

### Step 2: Adding JSON File Support

#### User Request
The user requested that the upload component should accept both CSV and JSON files.

#### Implementation
1. **File Type Extension**:
   - Updated file input to accept `.csv,.json` extensions
   - Modified client-side filtering to accept both file types
   - Updated UI text to indicate support for both formats

2. **File Parsing Logic**:
   - Added specialized parsing for JSON files
   - Implemented different handling for JSON arrays vs. objects
   - Extracted column names from JSON structure
   - Added row counting for JSON data

### Step 3: Fixing API Route Structure

#### User Request
The user encountered issues with the application not running properly due to routing conflicts.

#### Implementation
1. **Route Restructuring**:
   - Created a cleaner API route at `src/app/api/ingestion/route.ts`
   - Updated component to point to the new API endpoint
   - Removed conflicting route structures

### Step 4: File Management and Interface Improvements

#### User Request
The user requested addition of file display with accurate size information and download/use options.

#### Implementation
1. **File Size Display Fix**:
   - Updated file size formatting with proper units
   - Fixed display of file metadata in the UI

2. **File Management Options**:
   - Added download and use buttons for uploaded files
   - Implemented file storage mechanism for ingested files

## Current Functionality

The application now provides a fully functional data upload and management interface with:

1. **Intuitive Upload Interface**:
   - File drag-and-drop
   - File browser dialog
   - Visual feedback for upload operations
   
2. **File Format Support**:
   - CSV files - with header and row count extraction
   - JSON files - with automatic schema detection
   
3. **Backend Integration**:
   - API endpoints for storing and retrieving file data
   - Mock data storage (to be replaced with actual database)
   
4. **User Experience**:
   - Kaggle-inspired interface design
   - Responsive layout with appropriate sizing
   - Error handling and validation

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:

1. Integration with real database storage
2. More advanced file parsing and validation
3. Enhanced error handling and reporting
4. Progress indicators for large file uploads
5. Preview functionality for uploaded data
